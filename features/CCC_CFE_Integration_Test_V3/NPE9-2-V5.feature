Feature:
    "Applicant is a single person, with no dependents.
    They are an applicant in a non-molestation order case, so all upper thresholds donâ€™t apply.
    They do not own property, but do have some valuable assets. Outcome: income and capital contribution required. "

  Scenario: Test that the correct output is produced for the following set of data.
    Given I am undertaking a certificated assessment
    And A submission date of "2019-05-29"
    And A domestic abuse case
    And I add other income "friends_or_family" of 1278.01 per month, with bespoke dates: "2019-04-30" "2019-03-31" "2019-02-28"
    And I add multiple outgoing details including "rent_or_mortgage" of 700 per month, with bespoke dates: "2019-05-15" "2019-04-15" "2019-03-15"
    And I add 5000 capital of type "bank_accounts"
    And I add 3000 capital of type "non_liquid_capital"
