    "I have a property that is disputed"

    Scenario: A SMOD property where the value of the client's share of its equity is entirely disregarded
        Given I am undertaking a certificated assessment with an applicant who receives passporting benefits
        And I am using version 5 of the API
        And I add the following main property details for the current assessment:
            | value                     | 150000 |
            | outstanding_mortgage      | 0      |
