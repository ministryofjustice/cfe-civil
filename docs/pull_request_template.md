## Checklist

Before you ask people to review this PR:

- Diff - review it, ensuring it contains only expected changes
- Whitespace changes - avoid if possible, because they make diffs harder to read and conflicts more likely
- Changelog - add a line, if it meets the criteria
- Commit messages - say *why* the change was made
- PR description - summarizes *what* changed and *why*, with a JIRA ticket ID
- Tests pass - on CircleCI
- Conflicts - resolve if Github reports them. e.g. with `git rebase main`
