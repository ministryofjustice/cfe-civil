    # Check financial eligibility for legal aid.

    ## Usage:
      - Create an assessment by POSTing a payload to `/assessments`
        and store the `assessment_id` returned.
      - Add assessment components, such as applicant, capitals and properties using the
        `assessment_id` from the first call
      - Retrieve the result using the GET `/assessments/{assessment_id}`
  DESCRIPTION

  # Define one or more Swagger documents and provide global metadata for each one
  # When you run the 'rswag:specs:swaggerize' rake task, the complete Swagger will
  # be generated at the provided relative path under swagger_root
  # By default, the operations defined in spec files are added to the first
  # document below. You can override this behavior by adding a swagger_doc tag to the
  # the root example_group in your specs, e.g. describe '...', swagger_doc: 'v6/swagger.json'
